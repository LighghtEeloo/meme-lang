# Meme

A string template language hosted by Python3 runtime. Conventionally, the source code of this language is written in plain text with utf-8 encoding and stored in a file with extension ".meme".

## Philosophy

Human beings repeat one another, even themselves from time to time. Emerging from the dark flow of collective intelligence, memes are how we degenerated web inhabitants express our feelings, thoughts and very existence. The meme language is therefore introduced to DRY the web environment and encourage diversity across our mental homeland.

## Grammar

To keep the language implementation concise, the grammar of said language is aligned with the syntax described in [PEP 498](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/). 

Later you may find a detailed and formalized specification in `spec.pdf`.

## Usage

The language is based on [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), which can be installed [directly](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or via your system package manager. Make sure that you install a version that is superior than or equal to Python 3.6.

## Disclaimer

This is merely a joke. Donâ€™t take this seriously.
